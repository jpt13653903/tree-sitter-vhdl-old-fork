# Tree-sitter-vhdl

Tree-sitter-vhdl is a VHDL parser for syntax highlighting.

**NOTE:**  This is a work in progress.  Use at own risk.

## History

This version started off as a fork of
[alemuller/tree-sitter-vhdl](https://github.com/alemuller/tree-sitter-vhdl),
but ended up as a complete rewrite of the parser and highlighting scripts.  It
has very little in common with the original.

## Limitations

This parser uses a simplified grammar, because the full formal grammar in the
VHDL standard is highly ambiguous without compiling the entire code-base into
a symbol table.  In many cases, invalid syntax will parse into a valid tree.

For the same reason, there might be cases where valid syntax does not map
to a valid tree.  In this case, please
[log a bug report](https://github.com/jpt13653903/tree-sitter-vhdl/issues).

In addition, the following features are not implemented at the moment:

- IEEE Property Specification Language
- VHDL Procedural Interface

## Setup Process

This parser has not been merged into the official tree-sitter yet, so you need
to perform a manual setup process.
Configure your `treesitter.lua` (or equivalent) as follows:

```lua
local parser_config = require('nvim-treesitter.parsers').get_parser_configs()

parser_config.vhdl = {
  install_info = {
    url = "https://github.com/jpt13653903/tree-sitter-vhdl.git",
    files = { 'src/parser.c', 'src/scanner.c' },
    branch = 'new_parser',
    generate_requires_npm = false,
    requires_generate_from_grammar = true,
  },
  filetype = 'vhdl',
}

local treesitter = require('nvim-treesitter.configs')

treesitter.setup {
  ensure_installed = {
    -- Some list of languages...
    'vhdl',
    -- Some more languages...
  },

  -- Some other options and configuration...
}
```

Then copy the contents of the `queries` folder to your `after/queries/vhdl`
configuration folder, typically `~/.config/nvim/after/queries/vhdl` on Linux
and `~/AppData/Local/nvim/after/queries/vhdl` on Windows.

Finally, run `:TSUpdate`.

## Building

- Follow the instructions
  [here](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/creating-parsers#getting-started)
  to setup your development environment.
- Run `npm install --save-dev tree-sitter-cli`
- Run `node_modules/tree-sitter-cli/tree-sitter.exe generate`
