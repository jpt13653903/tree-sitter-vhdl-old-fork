# Tree-sitter-vhdl

Tree-sitter-vhdl is a VHDL parser for syntax highlighting.

This version uses the existing parser from
[Alexandre Muller](https://github.com/alemuller/tree-sitter-vhdl),
but the re-write is nearing completion.  Please use the `master`
branch of the [new repo](https://github.com/jpt13653903/tree-sitter-vhdl) instead.
